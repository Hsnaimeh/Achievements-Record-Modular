# Achievements App - Modular

<i>Ps: This is a example of Modular App Architecture.</i>

This example project gives you a rough idea how can build a scalable Android application and is an attempt to solve so following situation.

The given scenario: You are developing with many other developers on one Android app.

Question:

Speed?
Team Size?
Scalable?
Merge conflicts?
Separation?
Testing?
Buildtime?

Answer: Modularization! It is possible to split your app into several gradle modules. Each module can have their own responsibility and can be developed nearly independently.

# Summry
There are certain benefits in writing or migrating to Modular App and using Architecture Components with them.
  
Faster build times.
  
Fine-grained dependency control.
  
Improve reusability across other apps.
  
Improves the ownership & the quality of the codebase.

Stricter boundaries when compared to packages.
  
Encourages Open Source of the newly created libraries.
  
Makes Instant Apps & Dynamic Features possible (improving discoverability).
  
Remember, keeping modules Clean improves testability and eases future refactoring in case it needs to be shared between multiple user-facing features.
